# HEATMAP - Visual Game Data Analytics
This project was made by Jorge Gemas and Nadine Gutiérrez to analize data in game levels and be able to visualize it.

The players play the original game, and when they finish the level they save the game. We are able to load this data into our own Unity Scene containing the original map from the level. The next thing that we do is load assets to see the players actions:
- Deaths
- Kills
- Enemy Hits
- Acid falls
- Void falls
- Player path
- Game ID (we are able to load multiple games!)

## Controls
- K: Save data
- L: Load data (automatic)
- UI buttons
